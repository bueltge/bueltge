### Hi, I'm Frank ðŸ‘‹

I work at [Inpsyde GmbH](https://github.com/inpsyde/) and Zeiss AG. I help companies in making and developing business solutions for various software challenges, especially SAP and WordPress.

## Me :man:
I am reliable and optimistic. Especially important to me are honesty, tolerance and reliability. I am always looking for variety in sports, in everyday life and at work. The main thing for me is that I can take pleasure in what I do and get something out of it. That is why work is a very important part of my life. I work because it is important to me, not because I have to. Work is for me a wonderful confirmation of my existence, that I am needed, that other people need my knowledge, my doing. I like to spend time with many different things. And I am good at many things, but not a perfectionist. If I am too good at something, it often gets boring for me and I look for new challenges.

## WordPress and me
In 2005, I've written my first WordPress plugin and published it later into the pubic repository. I have published many more since, always free of cost, to give back to the community. I'm also part of the [pluginkollektiv](https://github.com/pluginkollektiv) to help maintaining some popular and widely used free plugins. Another result of my engagement in WordPress is the Inpsyde Agency and severla more activities in the WordPress bubble, like the organization of the first community camp in Jena ...

## ThÃ¼ringen erfahren :bicyclist:
Once a year I also organize a kind of cycling race called â€œ[ThÃ¼ringen erfahren](https://bueltge.de/thueringen-erfahren/)â€œ, mostly over about 500 km. But there are no first, second or third place and no prizes. The only goal is to arrive at the finish line, absolutely without any help from others â€’ including repairs if necessary. Otherwise, there are not many rules. I want to offer a challenge to people who like to cycle long distances. On such trips, I only stop for eating and shopping for food and usually ride through the night. I like the variety of this challenge. No restrictions, the goal is what you make of it.

## Motto :loudspeaker:
The human makes it.
