### Hi, I'm Frank ðŸ‘‹

I work at [Syde GmbH](https://github.com/inpsyde/) and Zeiss AG. I help companies make and develop business solutions for various software challenges, especially SAP and WordPress.

## Me :man:
I am reliable and optimistic. Essential to me are honesty, tolerance, and reliability. I am always looking for variety in sports, in everyday life, and at work. The main thing for me is that I can take pleasure in what I do and get something out of it. That is why work is a significant part of my life. I work because it is important to me, not because I have to. Work is, for me, an excellent confirmation of my existence, that I am needed, and that other people need my knowledge, my doing. I like to spend time with many different things. And I am good at many things, but I am not a perfectionist. If I am too good at something, it often gets boring for me, and I look for new challenges.

## WordPress and me
In 2005, I wrote my first WordPress plugin and published it later into the public repository. I have published many more since, always free of cost, to give back to the community. I'm also part of the [pluginkollektiv](https://github.com/pluginkollektiv) to help maintain some popular and widely used free plugins. Another result of my engagement in WordPress is the Inpsyde Agency and several more activities in the WordPress bubble, like the organization of the first community camp in Jena ...

## ThÃ¼ringen erfahren :bicyclist:
Once a year, I also organize a kind of cycling race called â€œ[ThÃ¼ringen erfahren](https://bueltge.de/thueringen-erfahren/)â€œ, mostly over about 500 km. But there are no first, second, or third place and no prizes. The only goal is to arrive at the finish line, absolutely without any help from others â€’ including repairs if necessary. Otherwise, there are not many rules. I want to challenge people who like to cycle long distances. On such trips, I only stop to eat and shop for food, and I usually ride through the night. I like the variety of this challenge. There are no restrictions. The goal is what you make of it.

## Motto :loudspeaker:
The human makes it.
